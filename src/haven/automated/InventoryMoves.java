 * Turns "where every item should end up" into "which messages to send".

 * Widget messages are reliable and ordered (Connection.java:340,795 on the way
 * out, 494-505 on the way in), so the server applies take/drop in the order
 * they were sent. The client therefore never has to wait for a reply - it has
 * to send a sequence the server will accept. That is what this class produces:
 * every move is checked against a model of the server's own rules before it is
 * emitted, so a refusal is impossible rather than merely unlikely.

 * Depends on nothing but haven.Coord, like InventoryLayout, so it stays

     *
     * Two move shapes, and no others:
     *
     *  - direct: the target rect is empty, so take and drop land cleanly. This
     *    is the only shape a multi-tile item ever gets.
     *  - chain: a 1x1 whose target holds exactly one other 1x1. Dropping swaps,
     *    the displaced item comes up on the cursor, and it is dropped on its own
     *    target in turn. The cycle closes on the hole the first take opened.
     *
     * Preferring direct moves is what removes the old eviction step entirely:
     * an item moved to its own target is never in the way again, whereas the
     * old code shoved items into whatever cell was free - including cells
     * inside the very rect it was trying to clear.
     *
     * A chain is tried on a scratch copy of the simulator before it is
     * committed. A drop along the chain is only ever refused because its
     * target holds a multi-tile item - a 1x1 target either continues the
     * swap or closes the chain. Blaming that on the swap victim (returning
     * its index as stuck, as an earlier version of this method did) pins the
     * wrong item: a swap only ever exchanges 1x1s among themselves, so it can
     * never free the multi-tile item's cells, and pinning the victim does
     * nothing to unblock the chain either - the multi-tile item is the actual
     * obstruction. So a chain that cannot close is deferred instead, which
     * does two things: it stops this same doomed candidate being re-picked
     * forever, and it lets the other chain candidates in this pass - who may
     * be blocked by the same item, or not blocked at all - still be tried. A
     * deferred chain does not become viable later in this same pass: closing
     * it requires the blocking multi-tile item to move, that item can only
     * move via a direct rect that this pass has already established does not
     * exist for it, and no chain commit can create one, since a chain only
     * ever rearranges cells among the 1x1s already in it. Deferrals are
     * cleared on every commit purely because the candidate set has changed
     * and is worth rescanning, not because a previously-blocked chain could
     * now succeed. What actually resolves the block is the tail below
     * choosing to pin a multi-tile item over a 1x1: once that item is pinned,
     * plan()'s outer loop reruns this method from scratch, with fresh
     * deferred state, against a layout that no longer routes anything
     * through the pinned item's cells.
